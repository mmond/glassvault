<b>What is this?</b>
It's a simple web application for sharing data.  It's modified to publish information helpful for our trip to Tuscany. <br>
<br>
Contents can be viewed, edited, deleted or downloaded.  It provides a place to share itineraries, contact information, travel tips, etc. The URL is not published or linked to from other sites.  Additionally, the simple password "italy" prevent bots and others from accessing the information. <br>
<br>
<b>What does it do?</b>
It organizes information into a tree layout.  These can be to-do's, packing lists, places to see, etc. Extended notes are available for saving info like flight schedules or hotel directions.  A text version is available, optimized for mobile devices.  A photo gallery allows uploading and browsing of pictures.  Links to off-site resources related to the trip are published.<br>
<br>
<b>Mobile Tuscanauts:</b> The info available at <a href="http://tuscanauts.com/mobile"><i><b>tuscanauts.com/mobile</b></i></a> provides a read-only version of Tuscanauts info. It is optimized for mobile devices, using minimal graphics and styling. Navigating to content works the same, by selecting links to expand or collapse an area.  If detailed notes have been entered for an item, a -oo- link (eyeglasses) will be displayed next to the item. Choose this to view the complete note details.<br>
<br>
<b>Photo Gallery: </b> The upload feature is still in development.  I'll activate this before the trip. Upload your pictures via FTP, then quickly browse them online.  They can be stored, shared, viewed and downloaded.  Archiving photos into Zip file downloads is provided.  Supported file formats for online browsing are jpeg, png and gif. A <a href="ftp://tuscanauts:Italy2008@tuscanauts.com/">link</a> with the embedded username and password is included on the <a href="http://tuscanauts.com/?content=tools/tuscanauts/gallery.php">gallery page</a>.  In case you need to enter the information manually, it is:<br>
<i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;username: tuscanauts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;password: Italy2008<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ftp site address:  tuscanauts.com<br>
</i>
Most FTP clients should work fine. Internet Explorer supports uploading files and directories. You can create directories to help organize your photos.  <br>
